here the player is a capsule(named-SagnikD)
placed in a rectangle like platform

capsule is made as a rigid body
gravity is working on it
rotations neglected to prevent it from falling down unnecessarily
->go to constraints then freeze rotations x,y,z in all 3 axes
Adjust the camera for a nice game view

for the controls or movement on capsule/player 
on Add components ->new script
then code is done on update part for movement in any directions
space-jump
forwars-^ up arrow
left right back vice versa done
in Physics portion i made dynamic & static friction as 0
for no problem in movement ,and bounce as 1

materials added to various platforms
obstacles such as cube cyclinder or quad is aslo added
press ctrl+D it helped in duplicating objects and maintaing same alignment


But I was unable to move platforms and the 3d objects/obstacles dynamically in the game
 
Anyways thanks Saurav sir for teaching the basics of Unity 3d very well

Thank You
whoever reads this txt file, its my first unity project.
